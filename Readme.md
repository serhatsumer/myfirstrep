my project
As I am a new candiate in using HTML and CSS, it was an exciting project and a challange for me.
In short, I have tried to use proper CSS classes and IDâ€™s and semanticly correct HTML5 tags.
I used simple grids in banners,
and tried to create a responsive layout with flexbox in main sections I used mobile-first approach to styling.

That is the starting point of my way. In the future, I would see from where I started.
