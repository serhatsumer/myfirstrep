             <h3>Cactus Love</h3>
              <p>How exciting ! We finally have some beautiful cactuses in our store! I am totally in love with the bright colours. 
                It’s like having plenty of long lasting flowers in my room that I don’t have to water too much:)
                So what do you need to know to start your cactus adventure  few lines on how to take care of cactuses:)</p>

             <h3>Water</h3>
               <p>Cactuses are easy plants and will definitely survive the periods of drought .. in your apartment :) 
                   but if you want them to thrive and grow you would have to water them once per week
                   especially during their growth period between Spring - Fall. Minimal or avoid watering when plant is dormant in winter.
                   Tip: Cactus plants are best left to almost dry out completely between waterings.
                   Insert a pen into the pot to check if the soil is dry :) Do not overwater or allow plant to stand in water.</p>

             <h3>Light</h3>
               <p>Potted cacti do best when they are exposed to sunlight for several hours per day.
                 In general bright light yes, but not all can tolerate intense, direct sunlight, especially in conjunction with high temperatures. 
                 If you spot dark patches on the surface your cactus needs some shadow!</p>

             <h3>Fertilizers</h3>
               <p>During the growing season, a balanced fertilizer, which has been diluted to 1/4 strength, can be added to the water for each watering</p>
