                  Amsterdam
                </h3>
                <p>From its humble beginnings as a 13th-century fishing village on a river bed to its current role as a major hub for business,
                  tourism and culture, Amsterdam has had a strong tradition as a centre of culture and commerce.
                  The official language of the Netherlands is Dutch.
                  The majority of Amsterdam’s residents speak English well and are often fluent in one or two languages on top of that.
                  You can usually get by effortlessly in Amsterdam without a knowing word of Dutch. For those keen to try,
                  learning a few words or phrases will always go a long way with the locals.</p>

                  Rome
                </h3>
                <p>Rome is the capital of the Italian Republic and the most populous and
                  largest municipality in Italy and is among Europe’s major capitals in terms of the amount of terrain it covers.
                  It is the city with the highest concentration of historical and architectural riches in the world.
                  Its historical centre, outlined by the enclosing Aurelian Walls, layering nearly three thousand years of antiquity,
                  is an invaluable testimony to the European western world’s cultural, artistic and historical legacy and in 1980 it was,
                  together with the Holy See’s property beyond the confines of the Vatican State
                  as well as the Basilica of St. Paul outside the Walls, were added to UNESCO’s World Heritage List .
                  Rome, the heart of Catholic Christianity, is the only city in the world to host an entire foreign state within its confines,
                  the enclave of the Vatican City, and it is for this very reason that it is often referred to as the capital of two States.
                  Over 16% of the world’s cultural treasures are located in Rome (70% in all of Italy).</p>
